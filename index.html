      <p>Welcome to my introduction to coffee website! This is the index, which
      explains what each page is about.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <a href="./about.html">about</a> page is the introduction to the
        very basics of coffee: what it is and how it's made.</li>
        <li>The <a href="./content.html">tasting</a> page explains what flavors
        can be present in coffee and how to discover and describe them. It also
        covers how the flavor can be affected by different variables: primarily
        roast level, brewing parameters, and origin (briefly, as origin is the 
        focus of the <a href="./location.html">origins</a> page.)</li>
        <li>The <a href="./location.html">origins</a> page describes the flavor
        profiles of various origins for coffee and at least briefly addresses all
        significant coffee-growing regions on Earth.</li>
